// Steam, read-only: leaderboard entries, the files attached to them (ghost replays) and workshop searches, through
// the game's own steam_api64.dll (its flat C API; the game's Steam plugin wraps the same calls). Requests are polled
// once a frame (ISteamUtils IsAPICallCompleted / GetAPICallResult), so nothing is registered with Steam and nothing
// runs outside the game thread.
//
// Layouts and values are from the Steamworks SDK headers as Steamworks.NET generates them (8-byte packing on
// Windows): LeaderboardFindResult_t (1104), LeaderboardScoresDownloaded_t (1105), LeaderboardEntry_t,
// RemoteStorageDownloadUGCResult_t (1317), SteamUGCQueryCompleted_t (3401), SteamUGCDetails_t. The interface versions
// are the ones the game's DLL exports (SteamUserStats_v013, SteamRemoteStorage_v016, SteamUGC_v021, SteamUtils_v010).
// Game thread only.
