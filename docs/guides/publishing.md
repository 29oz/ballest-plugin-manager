# Publishing a plugin

Players install plugins from the in-game browser, which lists everything in the **registry**:
[`registry.json`](https://github.com/AnythingGoes-ballest/ballest-plugin-manager/blob/main/registry.json) in the
plugin manager's repo.

## How the registry keeps players safe

Each registry entry is pinned to one **commit** of the plugin's GitHub repo, and lists the **SHA-256** of every file.
The game downloads each file from that exact commit and checks it against the hash before writing anything. A
changed file, or a changed repo, can't reach players until a new version is added to the registry, so every version
players get is one that was reviewed.

## 1. Put your plugin in its own GitHub repo

The repo holds what the plugin folder holds, at the top level:

```
info.toml
main.as          (and any other files listed in info.toml)
icon.png         (optional: 256x256; without one the browser shows a default icon)
README.md
LICENSE
```

In `info.toml`, set a `description` (shown in the browser), and `min_host` if you use API added in a later version of
the plugin manager (see [info.toml](../reference/manifest.md)).

## 2. Tag a version

The tag is the version number with a `v`, and must match `version` in `info.toml`. A tag is all that's needed; you
don't have to make a GitHub release:

```
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## 3. Ask for it to be added

Open an issue on the [plugin manager repo](https://github.com/AnythingGoes-ballest/ballest-plugin-manager/issues)
with your repo and the tag. The maintainer reviews the code and adds it:

```
python tools/registry.py add ../your-plugin-repo v0.1.0
```

That records the tag's commit and every file's hash in `registry.json`. Once it's pushed, the plugin shows up in
everyone's browser the next time the registry loads.

## Several plugins in one repo

A repo can also hold several plugins, each in its own folder with the same files as above:

```
plugins/
  grind-stats/     info.toml  main.as  icon.png  README.md
  other-plugin/    ...
LICENSE
```

Each plugin is versioned on its own, so its tags start with its id: `grind-stats-v0.1.0`. In the issue, give the
plugin's folder as well as the repo and the tag. It's added with `--path`:

```
python tools/registry.py add ../your-plugins-repo grind-stats-v0.1.0 --repo you/your-plugins-repo --path plugins/grind-stats
```

The plugin's id is its folder's name. Plugins in a shared repo need plugin manager 0.12.0 or later, which the
registry entry's `min_host` asks for by itself.

## Updates

An update works like the first version: a new tag, then a request. You don't need to make a GitHub release; the tag is
all the registry uses.

1. Make your changes and raise `version` in `info.toml`.
2. Commit and push, then tag that commit with the new version and push the tag:

    ```
    git tag v0.2.0
    git push origin v0.2.0
    ```

    In a repo with several plugins the tag starts with the plugin's id, as before: `grind-stats-v0.2.0`.

3. Open an issue with the new tag (and the plugin's folder, for a shared repo). The maintainer reviews what changed
   since the last version and adds it the same way:

    ```
    python tools/registry.py add ../your-plugin-repo v0.2.0
    ```

Pushing new commits or a new tag doesn't reach players by itself: the registry keeps pointing at the reviewed commit
until the new version is added.

Once it's added, players who have the plugin see **update** on its card in the browser. The new version is downloaded
and checked in full before it replaces the old one, so a failed download leaves the old version working. Files the
new version no longer lists are removed. What the plugin saved with `Storage` and its settings are kept, since they're
stored outside the plugin's folder.

Never move a tag or reuse a version number you've already published: the registry holds that commit's file hashes,
and installs of that version would fail the check. Fix mistakes with a new version instead.

## Before you publish

- [ ] It loads with no compile errors or warnings in the log.
- [ ] It stays well inside its time budget: no stopped status after an hour of play.
- [ ] It saves with `Storage` every few seconds at most, not every frame.
- [ ] Its windows don't cover the game's own UI by default, and can be hidden.
- [ ] The README says what it does, with a screenshot.
